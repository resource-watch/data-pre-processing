## Trawling Activity Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Global Fishing Activity](https://globalfishingwatch.org/?utm_source=wri_map&utm_medium=api_integration&utm_campaign=ocean_watch) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/6ccfb266-20cd-4838-82b0-5309987a62f0).

The data was retrieved using a Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API. To get tiled PNGs of fishing effort for each year (from 2012 to 2020), nine `GET` requests were sent to the GFW API. The request filters data for the desired `date-range` and `geartype`. For the Trawling Activity dataset, we requested data for `dredge_fishing` and `trawlers`. The API response includes a URL template for retrieving individual image "tiles" according to the location and zoom level, which Resource Watch uses to display the map of fishing activity (of certain types).

#### Example: Request for trawling activity from 2012-2013
```
https://gateway.api.globalfishingwatch.org/v2/4wings/generate-png?interval=10days&datasets[0]=public-global-fishing-effort:latest&color=%23ff3f34&date-range=2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&filters[0]=geartype in ('dredge_fishing','trawlers')
```
###### The request must contain the authorization header and a token as the value. Otherwise, the request will return an authorization error. GFW has provided WRI Ocean Watch with a token for our use.
