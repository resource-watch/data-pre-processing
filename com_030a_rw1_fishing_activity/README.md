## Fishing Activity Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Global Fishing Activity](https://globalfishingwatch.org/?utm_source=wri_map&utm_medium=api_integration&utm_campaign=ocean_watch) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/11f16cb9-def0-4bd5-a60e-50c542b837e3).

The data was retrieved using a Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API. To get tiled PNGs of fishing effort for each year (from 2012 to 2020), nine `GET` requests were sent to the GFW API. The request filters data for the desired `date-range` and `geartype`. For the Fishing Activity dataset, we requested all gear types except `dredge_fishing` and `trawlers`. The API response includes a URL template for retrieving individual image "tiles" according to the location and zoom level, which Resource Watch uses to display the map of fishing activity (of certain types).

#### Example: Request for fishing activity from 2012-2013

###### The request must contain the authorization header and a token as the value. Otherwise, the request will return an authorization error. GFW has provided WRI Ocean Watch with a token for our use.
