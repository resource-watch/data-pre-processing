This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Certified Forest](https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/13a621d222c243dc906d7ee53d13eff3) dataset for [display on Resource Watch](in progress).

The data was accessed through the source's API and downloaded as a GeoJson file. Below we describe the main steps taken to process the data so that it is formatted correctly to be uploaded to Carto.

1. Read in the data as a geopandas dataframe and subset the dataframe to select only columns of interest. 
2. Convert the table from wide to long form by melting the columns displaying years values into a single year column.
3. Convert the years in the 'Year' column to datetime objects and store them in a new column 'datetime'.
4. Convert column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores to match Carto column name requirements.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/for_021_rw1_certified_forest/for_021_rw1_certified_forest_processing.py) for more details on this processing.
