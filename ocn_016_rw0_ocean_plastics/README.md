## Plastic Density in the Oceans Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Modelled count and mass concentrations of plastic debris in the global ocean](https://app.dumpark.com/seas-of-plastic-2/#) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/d43690a2-75cc-473c-bf41-7af938ccf280).

The data was provided as GeoTIFF files within a zipped folder in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4XxjklEZhMtOEVHLXc1WlM5Wm8/view) from the data provider to the Resource Watch team.

To process the data, we used a Python script to download the data from Google Drive, shift the data for the longitude bounds to run from -180 to 180, and uploaded the data to Google Earth Engine.

Please see the [Python script]({link to Python script on Github}) for more details on this processing.
