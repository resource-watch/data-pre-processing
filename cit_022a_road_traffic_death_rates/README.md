This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Estimated road traffic death rate (per 100 000 population)](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.wrapper.imr?x-id=198) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/6b670396-c52c-430c-b5bb-20693da03b60).

{Describe how the original data came from the source.}

Below, we describe the steps used to {describe how you changed the data, e.g., "combine shapefiles for each continent into one global table on Carto"}.
