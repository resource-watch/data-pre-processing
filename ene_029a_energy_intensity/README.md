## Energy Intensity Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/sustainable-energy-all) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/ene029a-Energy-Intensity).

This dataset was provided by the source as a csv. The subset of energy intensity data was selected, and the table was converted from wide to long form, using Python.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/ene_0219_energy_intensity/ene_029a_energy_intensity.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed dataset for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/ene029a-Energy-Intensity).

You can also download original dataset [directly through Resource Watch](http://wri-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/resourcewatch/ene_029a_energy_intensity.zip), or [from the source website](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/sustainable-energy-all).
